## How to contribute

As an open source project we use the [Fork and Pull Model](https://help.github.com/articles/about-collaborative-development-models/).
You can find more information about collaborative development at GitHub in this article - [Collaborating with issues and pull requests](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests).

When you contribute code, please make sure that the changes are clearly identifiable. In particular, avoid making non-functional changes in the code which you do not touch, 
e.g. auto-formatting of an entire compilation unit.
